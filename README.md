This documentation provides instructions on how to run the "script.py" file via the terminal on Windows and Linux operating systems. Before proceeding, ensure that you have Python installed and have the "script.py" file in the desired directory.

### 💻 Windows

1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
2. Navigate to the directory containing "script.py" using the `cd` command.
3. Execute the script with the command `python script.py`.

### 💻 Linux

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing "script.py" using the `cd` command.
3. Execute the script with the command `python3 script.py`.

Follow these steps to run "script.py" successfully on both Windows and Linux systems. Remember to replace `path/to/script` with the actual path to the file if it is not in the current working directory.
